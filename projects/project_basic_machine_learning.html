  <h2>First Basic Machine Learning Project</h2>
  <p>I first used basic machine learning to make something. In this project there are a number of agents.
    The goal is that the agents find the shortest path to the goal (purple). The agents are made up of a list of numbers which represent the amount of acceleration applied each simulation cycle.
  The agent that does the best (gets closest to the goal) has its code/list of acceleration amounts copied to all the other agents and the simulation is run again. There are also obstacles
  such as bombs (the circles). These are placed to make the paths to the goal more challenging. In most cases, the agents eventually find a path to the goal. I made this to learn about a way that
  machine learning might be implemented.</p>
