  <h2>Controlling Dell Server Power with Nodejs</h2>
  <p>Recently, I acquired a dell r610. I've mainly been using it as a plex media server with sonarr and qbittorrent.
  However, with the coming summer, my room (and therefore my server closet) have had increased ambient temperature. This
  has led to the r610's temperature increasing and the fans spinning up uncomfortably. Because of this, I have taken to turning off
  the server when it is not in use (which is most of the time). The main way I have been turning the server on and off has been through
  the idrac interface. This consists of the following: navigate to the idrac page; log in; navigate to the power control page;
  then, hit the apply button (the option to turn on/off is autoselected). I find this to be a pain as it requires not just a
  number of steps, but also mouse movement to select buttons in idrac. I personally dislike moving my hand from the keyboard
  to the mouse.</p>

  <p>So, I decided to make a program that met my requirements. The program must: allow powering on and off of the r610;
  it must allow me to do so with minimal mouse movement; furthermore, I should be able to access it from any of my devices
  on my local network. I decided to create a simple web page with a Nodejs backend that would user ipmitool to turn on,
  turn off, and query the server's power state.
  <br> Code is available <a href="https://github.com/starwar15432/node_dell_power/blob/master/app.js">HERE</a>
  <br> You can see a screenshot of the finished product below.
  <br> It's simple and consists of some text given information on the r610's power status, an on button, and an off button.
  These buttons link to <code>/on</code> and <code>/off</code>. The backend reads this and runs ipmitool to turn the server on/off.
  Every few seconds the page refreshes/redirects to the home page to refresh the r610 stat. This program allows me to easily turn the
  server on or off from any device on the local network. It also allows me to do so with just my keyboard. I can even add
  <code>/on</code> or <code>/off</code> when selecting the url to quickly affect the server's power status. This program meets my needs
  and I have found it very useful the past few days I have been using it.</p>
