  <h2>Neural Evolution (NEAT) Attempt</h2>
  <p>I attempted to use neural evolution in a machine learning implementation. The goal of this project was to implement the NEAT (Neuro Evolution of Augmented Topologies) algorithm
  as put forth by  Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Mikkulainen in their paper title "Efficient Evolution of Neural Network Topologies". I wrote this implementation in processing, using Java.
  I did this to learn more about neural networks and ways to implement and use them. For this project I used the same 'environment' as in my basic machine learning project. However, instead
  of agents that were made up of a list of acceleration amounts, in this project the agents are made up of neural networks. In order to test the neural networks better I had the starting position
  and the goal position change randomly. Overall, the project was successful and the neural networks found their way to the goal even when it was moved.</p>
