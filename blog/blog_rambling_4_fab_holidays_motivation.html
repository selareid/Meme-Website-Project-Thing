  <h2>FaB, the Holidays, and Motivation</h2>
  <p>So many things. So many things to do. The holidays are here; there is nowhere I must be.
  Yet, I do not do the things I meant to do. Instead, the days go by fruitlessly, nothing getting done, and
  everything remains as it was at the start. Flesh and Blood, this card game is fun. I have been playing it recently.
  However, I cannot say it is distracting from the things I had wanted to do. The things I know. Yet, the motivation
  is just not there. How does one do things. I sit with my legs crossed above me. I barely want to watch shows;
  even the motivation for this is fading. Two more months to go. I wonder what will happen.</p>
