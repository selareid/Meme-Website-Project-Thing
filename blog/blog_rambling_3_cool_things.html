  <h2>Ramblings about the rails</h2>
  <p>Rails are cool. Wow. What a statement. You may disagree, but I say rails are cool. Rails are cool.
    However, they're not as cool as construction. But like, they have to be constructed. That requires construction-which is cool.
    Trains are cool though-cooler than rails anyway. So, that's cool. You know what else is cool? Railguns are cool.
    They aren't as cool as trains, but they're still cool. There's a show about a railgun. It's prety meh, but railguns are still cool.</p>
