  <h2>Non-sensical Rambling 1</h2>
  <p>Buses are better than cars when traveling alone. They make sense to reduce congestion and fuel cost. Boats are also safer to use than cars.
  In a bus accident, at least the driver will be hit at least once, rather than just once or twice by the passengers (depending on the car crash).
  Boats come in all shapes and sizes and can be used for pretty much everything; at least in theory. However, they are only available on water.
  There are few options that are so long and so cheap as a bus. It doesn't take much fuel and can be used practically anywhere and in any weather condition.
  Bus transportation is really simple and safe and if you are transported at the right time, you can travel from different cities to the same one, all the way from countries away even.
