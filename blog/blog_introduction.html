  <h2>What Is This Thing?</h2>
  <p>This blog. What a thing. It seems full of nonsensicalities. And it is. That is an undeniable fact. In fact, this is one. I wrote these nonsensicalities and I will continue to.
  For this is my blog. I will put in it what I shall want to. Maybe one day something here will make sense. If you want serious posts look at my projects.</p>
