  <h2>Ramblings about the end</h2>
  <p>Where am I. What has gone. Should I continue. Is it time to end. This really is getting out of hand.
    How will it end. Do I want to end like this. Is this how it all ends. Is this what I want to be.
    Should I not end like this. Should I want to stop. Do I need to end like this again.Surely not.
    The pain of past ends. Is this what it means. All returning to nothing. This isn't what we want.
    I don't want. I don't want to return there. No. I won't. But then, how will it all end.</p>
